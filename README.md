# FDC::db
```
Subject: FDC-db - a perl db abstraction convenience function module
From: Todd T. Fries <todd@fries.net>
To: anyone reading this
```

# INTRO
FDC::db was born of a desire to abstract the perl database funciontality.

It seemed silly to always check for the same errors constantly and repeat
code over and over every time a sql call was made, bloating functions, and
making code hard to read.

This now retries up to 10 times if the db server is unavailable, and has other
convenience functions.
